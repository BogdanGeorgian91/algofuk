          The highest product of two numbers from the Array which is also a Fibonacci number is
          <span id="solution">?</span> and it is found at index
          <span id="solution-index">?</span> in the Fibonacci Array.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note that the Array is created with random generated numbers
          according to your number inputs above, after which it will be purged
          so that only unique numbers remain. That is why the length of the
          Array might be smaller than the value chosen by you, as the duplicates
          were taken away. Therefore, it's better to use big numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, if the number is fucking <span id="zero">0</span>, it means
          that there is no product of any given pair of numbers from the Array
          which is also a fucking Fibonacci number. Just keep clicking <i>Search</i> to generate another random Array of numbers.
